        <h2 id="che">Kadapa Chennur Dum Biryani</h2>
        <img class="a"src="chennur.jpg" alt="Kadapa Chennur Dum Biryani"><br><br><br<br>
        <p>Kadapa Chennur Dum Biryani is a flavorful and spicy biryani dish popular in Andhra Pradesh. It is made with fragrant basmati rice, tender meat (usually chicken or mutton), and a blend of aromatic spices.
            From North to South, whenever we talked about Biryani with our Indian friends, several cities were mentioned such as Lucknow, Kolkata, Malabar, Ambur and with great prominence the city of <strong>KADAPA</strong>.

                We have tried it in almost every major city we visited in India and all deserve the fame it has for its particularities.<br><br> Therefore, despite the immense discussion we have witnessed several times about the best Biryani, the choice was always very personal. It involves other elements beyond the taste, a lot of affective memory and unique moments that is experienced around the dish.
                
                In our case, the one we liked the most was the Hyderabadi Dum Biryani which we learned during a culinary course in Hyderabad.<br><br> When you prepare the food yourself, everything gets better!
                Besides India, you can find different versions in several countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and even Thailand.

                In Penang, Malaysia we became fans of the delicious dishes of Nasi Kandar with Biryani rice.
                
                In Thailand, we proved the Khao Mok Gai (Thai chicken Biryani), an interesting and aromatic version that also use several spices but it is not as tasty as the Malaysian version.<br><br><br>

It consists of rice, turmeric, tamarind, curry leaves, coriander, ginger, and green chiles. <br>Additionally, yellow lentils, roasted sesame seed powder, and mustard seeds can be added to enhance the already rich flavors of the dish.

It is commonly prepared for festivals, yellow in color due to turmeric - considered sacred and symbolizing festive occasions in the Hindu world. The word puli in its name means sour, reflecting the tangy flavor of the dish. However, spicy and salty flavors that are also present in the dish are well balanced with the sour tamarind.<br>

Other states also have their versions of pulihora, so in Tamil Nadu, it is called pulisadham, and in Karnataka, the dish is known as puliyogare. It is traditionally served with sun-dried chiles and yogurt (which is not vegan), making it a complete meal that is said to taste the best after resting for a couple of hours following its preparation.

        <img src="uggani.jpg" alt="Gongura Pachadi">
        <p>Uggani or Puffed rice upma is a popular breakfast dish from Rayalaseema, Andhra Pradesh.<br><br> We make this dish with Borugulu or Puffed Rice. This dish is a very popular snack in Anantapur district and is not done in other parts of Rayalaseema.
            I was first introduced to this dish after marriage when I visited my in-laws' place. Imagine my surprise when I got to see big moulds of Uggani in roadside shops. They have this as a big heap with Green chilies decorated on top. The best and the ultimate side dish for this Uggani is Mirapakaya Bajji.
            When Athamma started living with us, she made it for us for dinner as we found eating it for breakfast was really tough.<br><br> She makes Onion pakoras for me and hot Mirapakaya Bajji for my hubby. I was most fascinated and interested as this involves making bajjis or pakoras. When my brother was living with us, we used to make it so often. Athamma was just remembering the other day about how much my brother loved it and how we used to make it for him.
            The original intro and pictures were taken during May 2007 and I finally came around updating with new pictures after 10 years! Athamma no longer lives with us and has made our home her summer resort! So when she is here, we again make dishes she is famous for. I wanted a rustic look by using steel plates but ended up with ceramic ones. I must now dig out those street wala pictures.</p>

        <p>
            gutti vankaya curry recipe | stuffed brinjal
             curry |<br><br> gutti vankaya kura or koora with detailed photo and video recipe. an authentic and spicy curry recipe made with tender and small eggplant in a peanut and coconut-based gravy. the recipe mainly 
             hails from the andhra cuisine or telugu cuisine but popular among other south indian states too. it is generally served with indian flatbread like roti or chapati but tastes good with rice too.  
             well, this is not my first post of eggplant curry, neither a stuffed brinjal curry.i have posted quite a few variations till now in my blog including the north indian and karnataka version.<br><br> yet i was surprised when i was introduced to this new variation of stuffed brinjal curry. i was having our weekend dinner and we chose to have it in an andhra cuisine fine dine. we were planning to have some hyderabadi biryani, but my husband wanted to try gutti vankaya kura from the menu with some garlic naan. we both were extremely happy with the spicy and creamy texture of this curry and i personally thought of sharing this recipe immediately in my blog with a video. there isn’t much difference with the ennegayi recipe, but just that it is creamier and spicy.
             anyway, some of the important tips, suggestions and variations for a perfect spicy gutti vankaya curry recipe. firstly as i mentioned earlier the eggplant has to be tender and also small in size. particularly the purple coloured purple with stripes are ideal for this curry. secondly, <br><br>while you are preparing this curry, you have to be generous with the amount of oil added to make this curry. addition of oil lowers the spice level of the curry and at the same time, it makes it more creamy. lastly, increase or decrease the spice level as per your taste preference. you can control with the red chillies and also control by adding jaggery.

        <h2>Nellore Peddareddy Chepala Pulusu</h2><br><br>
        
        <img src="pedda.jpg" alt="Kadapa Chennur Dum Biryani"><br><br>
        <p>
            This nellore chepala pulusu is tangy, spicy and delicious. I grew up watching it how mom used to make it. Selection of fish is important for that authentic nellore style chepala pulusu.

It’s made in a wide vessel, so that all the fish pieces are not crowded or stacked over one another. My mom’s secret to the chepala pulusu is cooking in an earthen pot and a secret ingredient added (roasted mustard, Cumin, coriander and fenugreek seeds powder added at the end).

he proximity of the Andhra city of Nellore to Chennai has left an imprint on Chennai’s culinary culture.<br><br> I saw this influence closely when I moved to the city in 2000. Back then, there were not many good Kerala restaurants, so whenever I craved seafood, I would go to an Andhra restaurant for Nellore Fish Curry. It has a wonderful depth of flavour – tamarind and tomatoes give it acidity, and chillies add a pop of heat. Try it out and enjoy it with steamed rice.
Chepala pulusu is an Andhra fish curry, which is a famous spicy seafood recipe, prepared by cooking fresh fish pieces in tangy tamarind sauce with lots of hot spices.

I love to try different cuisines every time when I make a nonveg recipe. After all we Indians are so blessed with a variety of different delicacies around various parts of India.

This time my hubby wanted some spicy tangy fish curry for dinner and thus I ended up making this excellent Chepala pulusu …and like any other Andhra recipe, this one tastes great every time when I make this.

This method doesn’t require coconut milk or coconut paste hence it is tangier than other versions of fish gravies.<br><br> I have already posted a Chettinad-style fish curry(Chettinad meen kulambu) in my blog that you may want to check.

Among other nonveg items, seafood is considered healthy and of course, fish is the top choice. I made this Andhra chepala pulusu with black pomfret today. But this chepala pulusu tastes good with freshwater fish.

Eating fish regularly benefits brain health and enhances the function of the nervous system. Gradually include fish food in your kids’ meal and make it a practice to eat fish once a week.
